# Shutdown_timer
This is a shutdown timer created using Python.

This app was created as my first working app using Python. Use it as you wish, the source code is downloadable from my 
github - https://github.com/DaveFranklin192/Shutdown_timer.git

Do as you wish with the code. As to the correct method of creating code in Python, I do not know if this is the approved standard.
